# Events Platform

## Summary

This is a full-stack web application where users can browse, sign up for, and manage events. Staff users can also create and organise events. The platform includes authentication, protected routes, accessibility features, and responsive design.

Built with:

- Frontend: React, React Router, CSS Modules
